## Introduction

[InsightFace](https://insightface.ai) is an open source 2D&3D deep face analysis toolbox, mainly based on PyTorch and MXNet. 

Please check our [website](https://insightface.ai) for detail.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.6+** and/or **MXNet=1.6-1.8**, with **Python 3.x**.

InsightFace efficiently implements a rich variety of state of the art algorithms of face recognition, face detection and face alignment, which optimized for both training and deployment.

## Quick Start

Please start with our [python-package](python-package/), for testing detection, recognition and alignment models on input images.

## Face Detection

### Introduction

<div align="left">
  <img src="https://insightface.ai/assets/img/github/11513D05.jpg" width="640"/>
</div>

In this module, we provide training data with annotation, network settings and loss designs for face detection training, evaluation and inference.

The supported methods are as follows:

- [x] [RetinaFace (CVPR'2020)](detection/retinaface)
- [x] [SCRFD (Arxiv'2021)](detection/scrfd)
- [x] [blazeface_paddle](detection/blazeface_paddle)

[RetinaFace](detection/retinaface) is a practical single-stage face detector which is accepted by [CVPR 2020](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Deng_RetinaFace_Single-Shot_Multi-Level_Face_Localisation_in_the_Wild_CVPR_2020_paper.html). We provide training code, training dataset, pretrained models and evaluation scripts. 

[SCRFD](detection/scrfd) is an efficient high accuracy face detection approach which is initialy described in [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04714). We provide an easy-to-use pipeline to train high efficiency face detectors with NAS supporting.


## Face Alignment

### Introduction

<div align="left">
  <img src="https://insightface.ai/assets/img/custom/thumb_sdunet.png" width="600"/>
</div>

In this module, we provide datasets and training/inference pipelines for face alignment.

Supported methods:

- [x] [SDUNets (BMVC'2018)](alignment/heatmap)
- [x] [SimpleRegression](alignment/coordinate_reg)


[SDUNets](alignment/heatmap) is a heatmap based method which accepted on [BMVC](http://bmvc2018.org/contents/papers/0051.pdf).

[SimpleRegression](alignment/coordinate_reg) provides very lightweight facial landmark models with fast coordinate regression. The input of these models is loose cropped face image while the output is the direct landmark coordinates.
